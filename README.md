# MazeSimulator3000-Java
This is the Java code before I rewrote the project in JS on a website. Link: Will Add Later

A Java application using Java Swing that lets you do cool stuff with mazes. (Note: Very buggy).


Some features:
 - Randomly generate mazes to be simulated or exported in text-file format.
 - Draw and create your own mazes that can be simulated or exported in text-file format.
 - Simulate your maze with different search algorithms along with cool graphics that show you how the search works.
 - Export and import mazes from text-files.
