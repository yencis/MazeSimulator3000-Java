# MazeSimulator3000-Java
This is the Java code before I rewrote the project in JS on a website (not done yet). Link: Will Add Later

A Java application using Java Swing that lets you do cool stuff with mazes. (Note: Very buggy).


Some features:
 - Randomly generate mazes to be simulated or exported in text-file format.
 - Draw and create your own mazes that can be simulated or exported in text-file format.
 - Simulate your maze with different search algorithms along with cool graphics that show you how the search works.
 - Export and import mazes from text-files.

How to run:
 - Run Display.java

Information:
 - Home shows you the current saved maze that will be simulated. Set Size, Width, and Height in text fields.
 - Generate random generates a random maze and automatically saves it.
 - Simulate simulates (solves) the saved maze. Animated. Choose your algorithm in the Combo Box.
 - Custom Maze opens the custom maze editor. Click on an empty square to place a wall. Click a wall to get rid of it. Right click for start and finish.
 - Use Custom Maze saves the custom maze.
 - Export maze saves the maze into a maze.txt file. This file is overwritten every export/run so please copy the file.
 - Import maze imports the maze using the file path given in that text box.
